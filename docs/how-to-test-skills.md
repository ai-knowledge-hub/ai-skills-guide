# How to Test Skills

## Test types

1. Activation: skill triggers only on intended requests.
2. Workflow: tool/script sequence is followed.
3. Failure mode: missing data/tool errors handled safely.
4. Output shape: required sections/schema preserved.
5. Guardrails: no fabrication, risky actions require confirmation.

## Test evidence format

For each prompt:
- prompt text
- expected behavior
- observed behavior
- pass/fail
- notes
