# Design Principles

1. Outcome-first: encode business outcomes, not only tool calls.
2. Deterministic where possible: move math and strict rules to scripts/config.
3. Explicit routing: use clear keywords in `description` and `When to use`.
4. Guardrails by default: no fabricated numbers, uncertainty surfaced.
5. Testability: every skill ships with realistic prompts and expected behavior.
