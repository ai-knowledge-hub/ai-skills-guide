# Test Prompts

1. Create a Playwright smoke suite for `/`, `/skills`, and one skill-detail route in this repo.
2. Add a CI job that runs only smoke E2E checks for `apps/web`.
3. A filter dropdown label changed in `/skills`; heal the failing test with minimal selector updates.
4. Generate a new smoke test for the install copy button and prove click behavior.
5. Review existing E2E tests and propose what should remain smoke vs move to regression.
