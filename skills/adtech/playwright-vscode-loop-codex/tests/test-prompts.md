# Test Prompts

1. Create a planner scope for smoke UX checks on `/`, `/skills`, and one detail page.
2. Generate Playwright smoke specs using monorepo-safe config paths in `apps/web`.
3. Run and heal a failing selector after a filter label changes.
4. Summarize run artifacts and residual UX risk after healing.
5. Adapt the same workflow to a new app directory while keeping Codex orchestration.
