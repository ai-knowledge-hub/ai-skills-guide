1. Run the weekly BI workflow end to end and block publish if any critical QA check fails.
2. Generate dashboard outputs, validate QA, and provide executive narrative only when QA passes.
3. Orchestrate this week's reporting and return publish decision with clear blocking reasons.
4. Re-run the workflow with strict reconciliation thresholds and include alert payload on failure.
5. Produce the consolidated output package with deterministic section ordering.
